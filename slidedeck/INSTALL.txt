activate the new version of SlideDeck for WordPress.

6. If you downloaded your backed up skins in step 1, just re-upload them to the 
/skins sub-folder in the SlideDeck WordPress plugin folder. Please note that 
sometimes an update may have been done to one of the skins, make sure you check 
for any differences if you have modified one of the default skins that comes 
packaged with SlideDeck for WordPress.

## ABOUT ##

[Rodomontade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodomontade) is a very simple
template for creating a "personal" (or "vanity") site. A sort of retro
*about.me* for masochists :-).

## INSTALLATION/CONFIGURATION ##

To use this template, you need:

1. A site with support for PHP 5
1. Copy all files in this distro to your site
1. Configure some simple values in the file `config.php`
1. Create sections (slides) describing your life and activities
   in the directory `sections` under your installation.
   Each section should be wrapped in `DT`, `DD` tags. See
   [DL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/Element/dl) for
   syntax and information. There are some sample section files
   included that you can modify/delete/copy.
1. <span style='color: #280;'>OPTIONAL</span>:
1  Add any CSS customisations in `custom.css`
1. <span style='color: #280;'>OPTIONAL</span>:
   Add any additional HTML/JS elements (will likely need to
   be absolute positioned) in `footer.html`
